The bot was required to locate the target and throw a disc with proper calculated velocity and angle. The disc was supposed to hit the circular ball, topple it down and hence land itself in the target position. All this work ,needs to be complete within 3 minutes and the team landing maximum number of disc is declared as winner.",
